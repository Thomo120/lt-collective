        <title>Rise!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Some of you may be barely hanging on, standing amongst the ruins of a broken house. Standing amongst the wreckage and searching for answers amongst the foggy atmosphere. Hey, I’ve been there myself there is a raw and open vulnerable place that happens when one is trying to get out. This place of rawness reminds me of the amount of abandonment, struggles and anxiousness I’ve struggled over the past few years (I can only describe this as a constant wave hitting the rocks) crashing over and over again as one thing hits the next. It’s funny how on the outside we appear so perfect and yet inside we are reaching, fighting and beautifully looking up at the stars in the night sky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statistics say 45 per cent of people will experience a mental health condition in their lifetime and with this percentage on the rise, mental health ward beds filling up and doctors prescribing medications sometimes it’s too easy to give in to a society where reaching out can call out emotional triggers and bring out a common debate oh what is right and what is wrong. Yet I’m often reminded of the people behind the system and the process the families go through with their loved ones. Everyone experiences pain in their lives, and has done battle in their life and yet not everyone talks about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last couple of years has been rough on our family as we have had to continue to rise despite the endless talks with doctors, nurses and nutritionists. This wave of helplessness and constant worry is starting to ease though and although there has been tough times that have surrounded my brother’s mental health, depression, business, being a wife, church and many other topics I continue to pursue the horizon. To me, it’s always been about not giving up and instead of persevering, constantly looking at the blessings in my life and the magnificent beauty, despite the elephant in the room.  There is so much beauty in this world and also so much devastation and yet it’s often our perception which shapes the meaning we see. Mental health is tricky business not only does it hold tight to your perception but it flips it on the head. I’ve experienced this myself and the encouragement I’d like to make is the key to not breaking is to not shut down but instead take one step at a time and let down your barrier of emotions. Those steps are not easy but with time, love, understanding and joy, you will begin to see the light at the end of that old cliche tunnel, you will rise. I always encourage you to seek help because the mental health mountain isn’t climbed alone. Tell your loved ones, tell a friend, tell a doctor, tell a nurse, and tell yourself it will be ok. Just take one step at a time and slowly you will begin to rise!&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>About</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome! My name is Lauren Thompson, most blogs focus on a niche but instead this blog focuses on the collective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you love being inspired as a women, as a wife, as a person, as an entrepreneur, as a foodie, as someone who wants to dream and do and perserve than this blog is for you. The LT collective does more than just tick one box, it looks at going beyond what is seen and showcases real life stories and inspires the next generation on how to achieve more and live beyond the boxes of today. We believe that now more than ever realness and more love is needed within our world and we aim to deliver more than just an ordinary blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;about-me&quot;&gt;ABOUT ME&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lauren is a passionate mental health activist, business owner, entrepreneur, dancer, content creator, writer, photographer, painter, counsellor, blogger and loves thinking outside of the box. Passionate about life and people Lauren’s mixed bag of skills have often helped her create great empathy and rapport with people. Her love of the entrepreneur life grew from her experience of watching her brother Adam become a speaker and a successful events promoter all around the world. Lauren was born with her right brain not connected to her left and she had to work twice as hard to create these pathways (her teachers thought she would never be able to pass English) so naturally Lauren set out to prove them wrong. Lauren has gone through many hardships including abuse and mental health and often can be summed up by her family as a versatile, elastic band that does not break but continues to bounce back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren’s biggest hero in her life is her Dad who has been in business for fifty years (plus) and she continues to be inspired by his approach to business, counselling, coaching and life. To this very day, Lauren can still remember the first lesson he ever taught her which was that you are entitled to nothing until you start vacuuming the floors and start with the smallest things first. His work smarter, not harder methods are something she still uses today and along with her husband she continues to use this in their creative studio which embodies excellence.&lt;/p&gt;
