Welcome! My name is Lauren Thompson, most blogs focus on a niche but instead this blog focuses on the collective. 

If you love being inspired as a women, as a wife, as a person, as an entrepreneur, as a foodie, as someone who wants to dream and do and perserve than this blog is for you. The LT collective does more than just tick one box, it looks at going beyond what is seen and showcases real life stories and inspires the next generation on how to achieve more and live beyond the boxes of today. We believe that now more than ever realness and more love is needed within our world and we aim to deliver more than just an ordinary blog. 

#### ABOUT ME
Lauren is a passionate mental health activist, business owner, entrepreneur, dancer, content creator, writer, photographer, painter, counsellor, blogger and loves thinking outside of the box. Passionate about life and people Lauren’s mixed bag of skills have often helped her create great empathy and rapport with people. Her love of the entrepreneur life grew from her experience of watching her brother Adam become a speaker and a successful events promoter all around the world. Lauren was born with her right brain not connected to her left and she had to work twice as hard to create these pathways (her teachers thought she would never be able to pass English) so naturally Lauren set out to prove them wrong. Lauren has gone through many hardships including abuse and mental health and often can be summed up by her family as a versatile, elastic band that does not break but continues to bounce back. 

Lauren’s biggest hero in her life is her Dad who has been in business for fifty years (plus) and she continues to be inspired by his approach to business, counselling, coaching and life. To this very day, Lauren can still remember the first lesson he ever taught her which was that you are entitled to nothing until you start vacuuming the floors and start with the smallest things first. His work smarter, not harder methods are something she still uses today and along with her husband she continues to use this in their creative studio which embodies excellence.
