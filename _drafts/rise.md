Some of you maybe barely hanging on, standing amongst the ruins of a broken house. Standing amongst the wreckage and searching for answers amongst the foggy atmosphere.  Hey, I've been there myself there is a raw and open vulnerable place that happens when one is reaching out and yet feels as though they can't quite get up yet. This place of rawness reminds me of the amount of abandonment, struggles and anxiousness I've struggle over the past few years (I can only describe this as a constant wave hitting the rocks) crashing over and over again as one thing hits the next. It's funny how on the outside we appear so perfect and yet inside we are reaching, fighting and beautifully looking up at the stars in the night sky. 

Statistics say 45 percent of people will experience a mental health condition in their life-time and with this percentage on the rise, mental health ward beds filling up and doctors prescribing medications sometimes it's too easy to give into a society where reaching out can call out emotional triggers and bring out a common debate oh what is right and what is wrong. Yet I'm often reminded of those involved in this state the people and not the system. Everyone experiences pain in their life and has done battle in their life and yet not everyone 

Let me tell you I felt abandoned by my home, my church and my friends and yet they did not understand how each day it was a struggle to rise. It was hard to be honest when fellow Christians were telling me just to let it go, to be a certain way and to connect in a certain way. A box formed around me and an identity started to form that was not myself. I love the church but as a person yet I'm not sure if they really saw me in. In the depths of it all everything appeared normal as I was to wed my best friend and yet they couldn't see that I had a deeper mission... a deep and intimate calling to be more than I had experienced and what I was left was with no calls from those who thought themselves as once close.
