Some of you maybe barely hanging on, standing amongst the ruins of a broken house. Standing amongst the wreckage and searching for answers amongst the foggy atmosphere.  Hey, I've been there myself there is a raw and open vulnerable place that happens when one is trying to get out. This place of rawness reminds me of the amount of abandonment, struggles and anxiousness I've struggle over the past few years (I can only describe this as a constant wave hitting the rocks) crashing over and over again as one thing hits the next. It's funny how on the outside we appear so perfect and yet inside we are reaching, fighting and beautifully looking up at the stars in the night sky.

Statistics say 45 percent of people will experience a mental health condition in their life-time and with this percentage on the rise, mental health ward beds filling up and doctors prescribing medications sometimes it's too easy to give into a society where reaching out can call out emotional triggers and bring out a common debate oh what is right and what is wrong. Yet I'm often reminded of the people behind the system and the process the families go through with their loved one's. Everyone experiences pain in their life and has done battle in their life and yet not everyone talks about it.
