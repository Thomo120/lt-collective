Sometimes we all just need a break (not a Kit Kat break a proper break), things can be so overwhelming as women. There a lot of things we carry on our shoulders including the feeling whether we are really ever enough. Is our job fulfilling? Am I on the right path? PREACH GIRL!

We all handle stress differently and deal with things differently through our own personalities but one thing we all share is that small voice inside us, that small identifying voice which can either help or hinder us. That tiny little voice inside you can affect everything and it often can burst through from the best and worse of times. 

As a woman who constantly is overwhelmed I'm not going to say you should of handle it like this but what I will say is that it's perfectly ok to cry and sit eating a bunch of gluten-free brownies in the corner of your closet whilst pouring your heart and soul out. It's perfectly ok to not be ok and to have imperfections and love your fat anyway. It's perfectly ok to want more for your work life, your family and yourself. 

If I could tell myself anything at that moment it would be that when you feel overwhelmed all you want is a little bit of reassurance, faith, belief. One of my favourite quotes says " a sound character provides the power for which a person may ride the emergencies of life, instead of being overwhelmed by them. Failure is the highway to success". - Og Mandino 

Beautifully put it's all in there, it's magnificently made, each and every one of us has a gift to share with this world, a significant purpose that connects every being to each other. Failure is not the enemy, never be afraid of doing, or trying but instead be afraid of not trying at all, for all of this define's you; what you think, feel and be is up to, well you. I know how challenging thinking into 2020 can be this year I'm turning 30 and that is scary enough but instead of living in the overwhelm or the listening the small voice of non-purpose I'm just going to live in
