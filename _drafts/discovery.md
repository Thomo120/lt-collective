Recently I've been pondering, thinking and perhaps even going through something that is bigger than myself. I wouldn't call it a breakdown but more of a self discovery _(Let me explain)_

I recently went over to Bali and took eighteen days off work to not only explore but also to find who I wanted to be. Over this time I saw that I was struggling with what I call the self-worth envy what was extremely infuriated was just how much other people have gotten all these chances whilst I constantly was benched. _NO BABY WAS NOT PUT IN THE CORNER_ 

_Remember that bit in the movie Eat Pray Love where the main character played by Julia Roberts is leaving and there is that great scene between her and her best friend played by Viola Davis where she says " I wish I could go"_ 

_Am I really good enough?_ 

_What defines's us as good vs excellent?_ 

_Am I living my best life?_ 

_Am I jealous of my friend's lives?_ 

One of the things I found was that I was conforming to what others wanted me to be. What I wanted to be was unapologetically myself
